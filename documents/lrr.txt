Loading Ready Run, often abbreviated as LRR, is a Canadian entertainment company and comedy group known for their video and web content. Founded in 2003 by Graham Stark and Paul Saunders, Loading Ready Run initially gained recognition for their eponymous weekly sketch comedy videos, which they produced for over a decade. Their work is characterized by a quirky, often nerdy sense of humor and covers a wide range of topics, including video games, technology, and pop culture.

Over the years, LRR has expanded their repertoire to include a variety of other projects:

1. **Magic: The Gathering Content**: They are particularly well-known in the Magic: The Gathering community for producing a variety of content related to the game, including the series "Friday Nights" in collaboration with Wizards of the Coast, the game's publisher.

2. **Streams and Let's Plays**: LRR operates several Twitch channels where they stream video games, tabletop games, and other content. They are known for their engaging and humorous style during these live streams.

3. **Podcasts**: The group produces several podcasts covering topics such as video games, movies, and general comedy.

4. **Desert Bus for Hope**: Perhaps one of their most notable initiatives is the annual charity event "Desert Bus for Hope." It's a marathon streaming event where they play "Desert Bus," a notoriously monotonous and lengthy video game segment from the unreleased "Penn & Teller's Smoke and Mirrors." The event raises money for Child's Play, a charity that donates toys and games to children's hospitals.

5. **Other Comedy Videos**: In addition to their weekly sketches, LRR produces other series and one-off videos, maintaining their original comedy roots.

Loading Ready Run has cultivated a dedicated fan base and is known for their community interaction, creativity, and dedication to their craft. They represent a successful example of how independent creators can build a diverse and sustainable presence in digital media.
